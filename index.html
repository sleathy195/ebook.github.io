                <h2>Chapter 1: Learn to Use A.I. With Bitcoin</h2>
                <p>
                    Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) is no longer science fiction—it's already being used in finance and crypto to
                    make faster, smarter decisions. Let’s break this down simply:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Imagine having a robot assistant that watches the crypto market 24/7. It notices when prices are
                    about to go up or down, faster than any human. It then tells you what to do—or even places trades for
                    you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here are some ways to use A.I. in Bitcoin trading:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <b>Auto-Trading Bots</b>: Tools like <b>3Commas</b>, <b>CryptoHopper</b>, and <b>Coinrule</b> let you create
                        automated systems that buy and sell Bitcoin based on your rules.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Sentiment Analysis</b>: A.I. tools can scan social media and news to detect if people are feeling
                        positive or negative about Bitcoin.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Price Prediction Models</b>: Some programs use past price data to guess what might happen
                        next. It’s not magic, but it helps!
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    <b>Important:</b> A.I. tools are assistants—not crystal balls. They can help you, but you still need to
                    understand the basics to use them wisely.

                <h2>Chapter 2: Beginner Basics No One Explains</h2>
                <p>
                    Let's assume you've never used Bitcoin. That's okay. Here's the no-nonsense breakdown:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>What is Bitcoin?</b><br>
                    Bitcoin is a form of money that exists only online. It's not controlled by any government or company.
                    Think of it like internet gold. It's stored on something called the blockchain—a kind of public diary that records every transaction.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>How Do You Store Bitcoin?</b><br>
                    You use a wallet. This can be:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Custodial (e.g. Coinbase)</b>: Easy to use, like a bank, but the company holds your keys.</li>
                    <li><b>Non-custodial (e.g. MetaMask, Ledger)</b>: You control everything. If you lose your password (called a seed phrase), your money is gone forever.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    <b>What's an Exchange?</b><br>
                    This is where you buy or sell Bitcoin. Examples include Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken. Think of it like a stock market, but for crypto.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Reading a Chart</b><br>
                    A candlestick chart shows how prices move. Green means up, red means down. Each 'candle' can represent a minute, hour, or day of price changes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Common Words Explained Simply</b>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>HODL</b>: A funny misspelling of hold, meaning don't sell.</li>
                    <li><b>Gas Fees</b>: Extra costs when sending or trading crypto.</li>
                    <li><b>Market Cap</b>: Total value of all coins combined.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    <b>Staying Safe</b><br>
                    Never send crypto to strangers. Scammers love beginners. Double-check every address and website. Never share your seed phrase—ever.
                </p>

                <h2>Chapter 3: Bitcoin vs. USD The Truth</h2>
                <p>
                    Let's get real. Your dollar buys less every year. That's called <b>inflation</b>—prices go up, your money doesn't.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Example:</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>In 1990, $1 could buy 4 loaves of bread.</li>
                        <li>In 2025, $1 might not even buy one.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Bitcoin is different. It's <b>limited</b>—only 21 million will ever exist. No one can make more. That's like gold—but digital.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Why is Bitcoin Going Up in Value?</b><br>
                    Because more people want it, but there's a limited supply. Like rare Pokémon cards—if everyone wants one, the price goes up.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Companies and Countries Are Buying Bitcoin</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Tesla, MicroStrategy, and even governments (like El Salvador) are adding Bitcoin to their holdings.</li>
                        <li>Why? Because they see the dollar losing value and want to protect their wealth.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Bitcoin might look volatile in the short term (big price ups and downs), but over time, it's been one of the best-performing assets in history.
                </p>
                <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
                <p>
                    If this book made Bitcoin and crypto feel a little less scary, that's the point. You don't have to be a tech expert or a Wall Street investor.<br>
                    Start small. Learn by doing. And remember:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Use A.I. to help, not to replace your thinking.</li>
                    <li>Learn the basics, even if they seem boring.</li>
                    <li>Don't let the government steal your wealth slowly—consider crypto.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    You now have the tools to start your journey. Welcome to the future of money.
